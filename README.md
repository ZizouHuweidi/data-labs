### Insights
Provide valuable insights into the use of language, sentiment and discourse patterns

### Classification
classify into insults and not insults

### Frequency analysis 
Conduct a basic frequency analysis to identify the most common insults used in social commentary. This can help pinpoint which insults are more prevalent.

### Sentiment analysis 
Use sentiment analysis tools or natural language processing (NLP) techniques to categorize insults based on their sentiment (e.g., negative, neutral, or positive). This analysis can reveal the overall tone of the commentary.

### Contextual analysis
Analyze the context in which insults are used. Look for patterns in the topics or situations that trigger insults. Understanding the context can provide insights into the motivations behind the insults.

### Temporal analysis
Explore how the frequency and types of insults change over time. Are there specific events or trends that correlate with spikes in insulting language?
